# GIT Media Lab

Building music and video apps is easier than ever, once you figure out HTML Audio, HTML Video, Web Audio, Canvas and other web technology to support multi-media.

This is an app that demonstrates media pieces configured correctly and explained in depth. See the docs folder for detailed guides about audio, video, music APIs, metadata and more.

## Quick Start

This project uses:

- Node / pnpm
- Astro
- TypeScript

Install the CLI tools

```bash
brew install node
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Get the app

We start by getting and testing `medialab`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nzoschke/medialab.git
cd medialab
pnpm install
pnpm run test
```

This gives us confidence in our TS / JS / web environment.

### Develop the app

```bash
pnpm run dev

> medialab@0.0.1 dev
> astro dev
 astro  v4.8.6 ready in 285 ms
